# C++ Projects
In this C++ Projects Repositories I upload three Projects which completely base on  C++ concept. First Project is Library Management System Second Project is Gaming Emulator and Third Project is REVERSI AI Game.Basically these projects are collaborate of C++  and OOP base concept like loops,conditions, Inheritance, Polymorphism etc.

## Project 1: Library Management System
In this Project we make a Library Mangement System which base on C++ basic as well as Object Oriented Programming Concept.The main objective or aim of this project is basically you simply enter password and then press any key it well go to main menu. In main menu there are 12 differnt option like a in Library which is you can Create book, Modify a book, Search a book record, Delete a book record, Add a student record, Modify a student Record, Search a Student Record, Delete a Student Record, Check validity of book and student record, check a limit to issue a book, Return a book to Librarian. These are options in this Library Management Project.
